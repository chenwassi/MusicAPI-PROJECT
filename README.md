# Project Flow

### Difficulties
The difficulties were finding a suitable API that could be worked on and understood. Know how to implement and access that API and how to work with it.
### What was goood
What was good was saving in local storige, although I thought it would be more challenging and difficult to keep the data easier to work with.
